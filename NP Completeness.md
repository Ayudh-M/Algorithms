$f(n)$ is polynomially bounded if $f(n)\in O(n^c)$ this means that it runs in some time $O(n^c)$ where c is an integer.

Theorem: If $P\neq NP$, then Formula-SAT cannot be solved in polynomial time.
Theorem is was solved with contradiction, that it can be lecture 20 to 22 mins lecture 1 proof:

the sign means that the difficulty of A is at most as hard as B

this is proved at around 28 to 30 mins lecture 1, if there is any question where you have to prove with time you can do it this way because they explain time.
