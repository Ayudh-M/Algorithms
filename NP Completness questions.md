When problem A reduces to problem B, a solution to B can be used to solve A.
a polynomial time reduction of A to B provides a way to convert membership testing in A to membership testing in B—but now the conversion is done efficiently. To test whether w ∈ A, we use the reduction f to map w to f(w) and test whether f(w) ∈ B
