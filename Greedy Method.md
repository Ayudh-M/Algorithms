Firstly remember what we are doing here we are solving [[optimization problems]]
so our goal is not to find some correct solution to a problem rather it is to find the best solution, we already know that it has multiple correct solutions.

The idea for greedy methods is that you arrive at the final answer by making correct decisions at every step, and it must be the same decision every step and that will lead you to the correct final optimal answer. This is simmilar to the idea of [[Optimal Substructure]]
